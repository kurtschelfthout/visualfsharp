## Introduction

Type classes are an immensely popular and productive feature of Haskell.

(Almost as good as modules, sometimes better!)

So good, other languages have stolen them:
 * ~~C++ concepts~~ (for perf!)
 * Scala *implicits*
 * Rust *traits* 
 * Swift *protocols*
 * Coq (2 variants),Agda, Clean....

--

But not F# or C#.

##This talk:

We add type classes to F# using a cheap coding trick that is

* type preserving (no yucky erasure)
* efficient (thanks to .NET's run-time code specialiation)
* essentially free (zero VM modifications required)
* modular

For F#, we call type classes *traits* (Don's preference).

The same technique works interoperably for C# etc. 

*Trait F#* and *Concept C#* are implemented as open source prototypes.

---

##  Recap: Haskell Type Classes

Type classes are an abstraction mechanism for describing generic algorithms.

A *type class* is a predicate on types that specifies a set of required operations by signature.

A *class instance* declares class membership of a type by implementing each operation.

Type classes form hierarchies with *inheritance* and *subsumption*. 

A *generic instance* defines *families* of instances, predicated on class membership.

...



### Why should .NET care?

Instance declarations are decoupled from their types (unlike interfaces).

Type classes can have less overhead than OO abstractions. Even zero overhead.

Type classes allow efficient abstraction over numeric types (sorely missing in .NET).

##  Haskell Type Classes
 
We represent a Haskell type class, e.g.

```Haskell
  class Eq a where 
    (==) :: a -> a -> Bool
```

as a *generic* F# interface:
```fsharp
type Eq<'A> = 
    abstract equal: 'A -> 'A -> bool 
```

Trait F#
```fsharp
[<Trait>]
type Eq<'A> = 
    abstract equal: 'A -> 'A -> bool 
```

---

## Haskell Overloads

The Haskell declaration of class `Eq a` implicitly declares the overload:

```Haskell
    (==) :: (Eq a) => a -> a -> Bool  -- note the added constraint!
```

In F#, an overload  can be encoded as a generic function, parameterized by an additional type parameter `'EqA`.

```fsharp
 let equal<'A,'EqA when 'EqA : struct and 'EqA :> Eq<'A>> a b =
       defaultof<'EqA>.equal a b
```

The ordinary type parameter `'EqA` is:
* constrained to be a `struct` (allocable on the stack); 
* bounded by its interface (`'EqA: Eq<'A>`);
* a named *witness* for the constraint `Eq<'A>`.

(think `equal`: `forall 'A, 'EqA <: Eq<'A>. 'A -> 'A -> bool`)


> *Haskell dictionary value ~ F# witness type*

---

## Zooming in

Look closely:

```fsharp
 let equal<'A,'EqA when 'EqA : struct and 'EqA :> Eq<'A>> a b =
       defaultof<'EqA>.equal a b
```

Where is the *value* parameter for the "dictionary" that GHC would insert?

--

We don't need one!

In F#, primitive `defaultof<T>` has type `T` and returns a default value.

Using `defaultof<T>`, we can create dictionary values on demand, when required for calls.

Doing so explicitly is gross, so in Trait F#, we extend the dot notation to access overloads:

```fsharp
 let equal a b = Eq.equal a b // dot notation for trait members
                              // introduces constraints 
```

(The `struct` constraints ensure dictionary values are never 'null'; no call can fail.)

---


## Haskell Instances

A Haskell ground instance, eg.

```Haskell
  instance Eq Integer where 
    x == y                =  x `integerEq` y
```

is translated to an F# *struct* implementing a trait (i.e. interface).
 
```fsharp
[<Struct>]
type EqInt = 
      interface Eq<int> with 
        member this.equal a b = a = b
...
```

The struct is empty (think `unit`) but (!) has associated code.

Trait F#:
```fsharp
[<Witness>] // a.k.a instance
type EqInt = 
     interface Eq<int> with 
       member equal a b = a = b // no 'this.'
...
```
---


##  Generic Instances...

Haskells generic instances define *families* of instances.

E.g. 

Given an equality type `a`, we can define an equality
on *lists* of `a` (written `[a]`):

```Haskell
  instance (Eq a) => Eq [a] where 
       nil == nil      = true
    (a:as) == (b:bs)   = (a == b) && (as == bs)
         _ == _        = false
```

---

## ...Generic Instances

We can represent a Haskell *parameterized instance* as a *generic struct*, 
implementing an interface but parameterized by suitably constrained type parameters. 

```fsharp
[<Struct>]
type EqList<'A,'EqA when 'EqA : struct and 'EqA :> Eq<'A>> = 
    interface Eq<'A list> with
      member this.equal a b =  // this unused
          match a,b with
          | a::l,b::m -> equal<'A,'EqA> a b && // type args reqd!
                         equal<'A list,EqList<'A,'EqA>> l m
          | [],[] -> true | _ ,_ -> false
```

Trait F#:
```fsharp
[<Witness>]
type EqList<'A,'EqA when 'EqA :> Eq<'A>> = // 'EqA:struct implicit
    interface Eq<'A list> with
      member equal a b = 
          match a,b with
          | a::l,b::m -> equal a b && equal l m
          | [],[] -> true | _ ,_ -> false
```

---

## Constructing Evidence

Derived instances allow Haskell to automatically construct instances as evidence for constraints:

```Haskell
  --- Since Eq Integer and Eq a => Eq (List a),
  --- we have Eq (List Integer) hence Eq (List (List Integer))
   
   [[1],[2,2],[3,3,3]] == [[3,3,3],[2,2],[1]]  -- typechecks!
```

In F# `EqInt:>Eq<int>` so `EqList<int,EqInt> :> Eq<int list>` so `EqList<int list,EqList<int,EqInt>> :> Eq<int list list>`.

In F#, dictionary type arguments cannot be inferred... they usually don't occur elsewhere in the type!

```fsharp
   equal [[1];[2;2];[3;3;3]] [[3;3;3];[2;2];[1]] // type error

   equal<int list list,EqList<int list,EqList<int,EqInt>>> 
   	 [[1];[2;2];[3;3;3]] [[3;3;3];[2;2];[1]] // works
```

Programming in the encoding requires explicit type abstraction and instantiation.

---

## Instance Inference

No programmer should write this crap!

In Trait F#, we extend inference so witness type arguments are derived from the trait hierarchy.

Trait F#:
```fsharp
   equal [[1];[2;2];[3;3;3]] [[3;3;3];[2;2];[1]] // type checks! 
```

Witness are inferred using type driven backchaining, similar to Haskell.

This is an extension of F#'s existing type constraint solver (Don's the man).

---


##  Derived Operations 

We translate Haskell's qualified types as extra, bounded type parameters denoting witness parameters.

For example, equality based list membership in Haskell is defined as follows:

```Haskell
  elem :: Eq a => a -> [a] -> bool
  x `elem`  []            = False
  x `elem` (y:ys)         = x==y || (x `elem` ys)  
``` 

In F#, we can encode this as:
```fsharp
let rec elem<'A,'EqA when 'EqA:struct and 'EqA:>Eq<'A>> x ys =
    match ys with
    | [] -> false
    | y::ys -> equal<'A,'EqA> x y && elem x ys
```

Trait F#:
```fsharp
let rec elem x ys =
    match ys with
    | [] -> false
    | y::ys -> equal x y && elem x ys
```

---


##  Type Class Inheritance

Haskell supports (multiple) inheritance of super classes.

```Haskell
  class (Eq a) => Num a where
    Add: a -> a -> a
    Mult: a -> a -> a
    Neg: a -> a
```

* Forall types `a`, `Num a` derives from `Eq a`. 

In F#, we instead use ordinary (multiple) interface inheritance:
```fsharp
type Num<'A> = 
    inherit Eq<'A>
    abstract add: 'A -> 'A ->'A
    abstract mult: 'A -> 'A ->'A
    abstract neg: 'A -> 'A

type NumInt = 
    interface Num<int> with
      member this.equal a b = equal<int,EqInt> a b // named instance!
      member this.add a b = a + b
      member this.mult a b  = a + b
      member this.neg a = -a 
```

Trait F#:
```fsharp
[<Trait>]
type Num<'A> = 
    inherit Eq<'A>
    abstract add: 'A -> 'A ->'A
    abstract mult: 'A -> 'A ->'A
    abstract neg: 'A -> 'A

[<Witness>]
type NumInt = 
    interface Num<int> with
      member equal a b = equal<_,EqInt> a b 
      member add a b = a + b
      member mult a b  = a + b
      member neg a = -a 
```

* Haskell class inheritance ~ F# interface inheritance 

---
##  Subsumption ...
Subsumption derives (evidence for) a class from (evidence for) its subclasses.

```Haskell
    equals :: (Eq a) => a -> a -> Bool

    square :: (Num a) => a -> a 
    square a = a * a

    memsq :: (Num a) => [a] -> a -> Bool
    memsq nil a = false
    memsq (h:t) a =     equals h (square a) 
                     -- ^^^^ legal coz Num a |= Eq a 
                     || memsq h t
```
---

##  ... Subsumption

F#:
```fsharp
let square<'A,'NumA when 'NumA:struct and 'NumA:>Num<'A>> x =
     defaultof<'NumA>.mult x x

let rec memsq<'A,'NumA when 'NumA:struct and 'NumA:>Num<'A>> n a = 
      match n with
      | [] -> false
      | (h::t) -> equal<'A,'NumA> h (square<'A,'NumA> a)
                // ^^^^ legal coz 'NumA :> Num<'A> :> Eq<'A> 
                || memsq<'A,'NumA> n a
```
Trait F#:
```fsharp
let square x = Num.mult x x

let rec memsq n a = 
    match n with
    | [] -> false
    | (h::t) -> equal h (square a) || memsq n a
```



---

## MSIL ByteCode

IL:
```cil
.method public hidebysig static bool
    Equals< A, 
    	    valuetype .ctor([mscorlib]System.ValueType, class Eq.Eq`1<!!A>) EqA> 
   (!!A a,!!A b) 
   cil managed {
   .locals init ([0] !!EqA loc1,[1] !!EqA loc2)
   ldloca.s loc1  // stack allocate dictionary
   initobj !!EqA 
   ldloc.0
   stloc.1
   ldloca.s loc2
   ldarg.0
   ldarg.1
   constrained. !!EqA
   callvirt instance bool class Eq.Eq`1<!!A>::Equals(!0, !0) 
   ret
}
```
The `callvirt` instruction is typically used for an indirect call to a virtual method.

When `EqA` is a struct, due to specialization, the callee is always known and often inlined.

### Performance

Evaluating a polynomial `f(x:T) = x*x + x + (T)666` (in C#), 

where `T`=`int`, `double`, `Class3D`, `Struct3D`.

(We evaluate `f(x)` at `1m` values of `x` using the BenchmarkDotNet harness.)

```csharp
    T ConceptGenericOpt<T, NumT>() where NumT : struct, Num<T> {
       NumT NI = default(NumT);
       T y = NI.FromInteger(0);
       T c = NI.FromInteger(666);
       for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
          T x = NI.FromInteger(i);
          y = NI.Plus(NI.Plus(NI.Mult(x,x),x), c);
       }
       return y;
    }
```
Comparisons:
+ Baseline: non generic, hand-specialized  code (one per T)
+ AbstractClass: generic class based (OOP style)
+ Interface: generic interface based (OOP style)
+ Delegate: generic, firt-class function based (OOP/FP style)
+ Instance: trait based (one dictionary value per call)
+ OptimizedInstance: optimized trait based (CSE on dictionaries) (shown above)

![perf1](./images/bench/perf1.png)


At primitive value type instantiations, trait performance is as good as hand specialised code, and much better than OO abstractions.

---

![perf2](./images/bench/perf2.png)


At class instantiations, performance is slower than hand specialised code, but better than standard OO abstractions.

At user-defined struct instantiations, performance is much worse than hand specialized code, for both standard OO and trait abstractions.
This merits further investigation.

##x86 

This is the actual code jitted at `NumInt:Num<int>`:

```masm
00007FF9B5820D50  mov         byte ptr [rsp+20h],0  
00007FF9B5820D55  xor         eax,eax  
00007FF9B5820D57  xor         edx,edx  
00007FF9B5820D59  mov         ecx,dword ptr [7FF9B5704884h]  
00007FF9B5820D5F  test        ecx,ecx  
00007FF9B5820D61  jle         00007FF9B5820D75  
00007FF9B5820D63  mov         eax,edx  
00007FF9B5820D65  imul        eax,edx  
00007FF9B5820D68  add         eax,edx  
00007FF9B5820D6A  add         eax,29Ah  
00007FF9B5820D6F  inc         edx  
00007FF9B5820D71  cmp         edx,ecx  
00007FF9B5820D73  jl          00007FF9B5820D63  
00007FF9B5820D75  add         rsp,28h  
00007FF9B5820D79  ret  
```

Notice this is just straight-up arithmetic: despite copious abstraction in the source code, *no* function calls remain!

* Haskell 98's type classes have a type preserving .NET representation.
* Dictionaries can be manually constructed and provided or, better, inferred.
* Generated code is efficient:
    * Dictionaries are empty (stack-allocated) structs. 
    * Dictionary allocation has zero runtime cost.
    * CLR's code specialization ensures all dictionary calls are direct calls at runtime. Many are in-lined.
